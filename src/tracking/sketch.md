Evaluate model's trajectories

1. Match predicted trajectories with ground truth trajectories
2. Compute HOTA score for each predicted trajectory using each predicted trajectory's matching ground truth trajectory

Correlate loops with beta cells

1. Fetch prediction tracks
2. Fetch loops
3. Compare

Loops have unique pixel intensities in each 3D image.

How to find center:
