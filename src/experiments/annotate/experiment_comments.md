Compare Frangi, median, mean, Gaussian filters in /filter/

Choose median, Gaussian for annotate experiment in /annotate/

So /filter/ is for checking out the filters.
/annotate/ is for checking out combining the two filters I chose, with various annotation methods and thresholds.



Best so far I've seen:
00000_thresh_5_2_none

00374_thresh_17_0_gaussian_17_3
Best!
